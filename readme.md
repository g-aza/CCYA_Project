About the Project

Gazugoes is personal website, containing a variety of content of my choice, currently it features a list of travel destinations I know of, a bit of history about them, some images, and hopefully soon I will ideally implement users, comment sections, and so on to add to the playfulness of the Website. 
There is also a planned addition of an Automotive Section, and a history section, where I will be further able to write about and add content related to topics I am interested in.

I've tried to accomodate to UX by choosing a styleized yet contrasting colour pallette featuring a destinctive and constant navbar, with hover animations in case they are needed. All fonts chosen are in a Arial/ Sans-serif type font, commonly found and accessible to pretty much all computer systems. All images have an alt tag. I have tried to keep scripts light to reduce bloating and a slower website.
