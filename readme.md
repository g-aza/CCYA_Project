About the Project

Gazugoes is personal website, containing a variety of content of my choice, currently it features a list of travel destinations I know of, a bit of history about them, some images, and hopefully soon I will ideally implement users, comment sections, and so on to add to the playfulness of the Website. 
There is also a planned addition of an Automotive Section, and a history section, where I will be further able to write about and add content related to topics I am interested in.

Planning was mainly done through simple notetaking and use of wireframes. The 'persona' the site is aimed towards was one similar to mine, casual audience, simply people of any age, who have an interest in history, like geography, cars.

I've tried to accomodate to UX by choosing a styleized yet contrasting colour pallette featuring a destinctive and constant navbar, with hover animations in case they are needed. All fonts chosen are in a Arial/ Sans-serif type font, commonly found and accessible to pretty much all computer systems. All images have an alt tag. I have tried to keep scripts light to reduce bloating and a slower website.

Some SEO I considered is short yet clear use of urls, pagenames, and internal / external links to quality content. Studied other sites SEO and implemented clear features wherever possible while keeping page loading speeds fast and clear of slow loading plugins or elements.
